The Gradle team is excited to announce Gradle 5.1.

This release features [Stricter validation with `validateTaskProperties`](userguide/java_gradle_plugin.html), [2](), ... [n](), and more.

See the [Gradle 5.0 to 5.1 upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_5.html) to learn about breaking changes and considerations for upgrading from Gradle 5.0.

We would like to thank the following community contributors to this release of Gradle:
[Mike Kobit](https://github.com/mkobit),
[Kent Fletcher](https://github.com/fletcher-sumglobal),
[Niklas Grebe](https://github.com/ThYpHo0n),
[Jonathan Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh),

## Stricter validation with `validateTaskProperties`

Cacheable tasks are validated stricter than non-cacheable tasks by the `validateTaskProperties` task, which is added automatically by the [`java-gradle-plugin`](userguide/java_gradle_plugin.html).
For example, all file inputs are required to have a normalization declared, like e.g. `@PathSensitive(RELATIVE)`.
This stricter validation can now be enabled for all tasks via [`validateTaskProperties.enableStricterValidation = true`](javadoc/org/gradle/plugin/devel/tasks/ValidateTaskProperties.html#setEnableStricterValidation-boolean-).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

### Inherited configuration-wide dependency excludes are now published

Previously, only exclude rules directly declared on published configurations (e.g. `apiElements` and `runtimeElements` for the `java` component defined by the [Java Library Plugin](userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_configurations_graph)) were published in the Ivy descriptor and POM when using the [Ivy Publish Plugin](userguide/publishing_ivy.html) or [Maven Publish Plugins](userguide/publishing_maven.html), respectively.
Now, inherited exclude rules defined on extended configurations (e.g. `api` for Java libraries) are also taken into account.

## Known issues

## Potential breaking changes

<!-- add any notable changes here in a summary -->

Breaking changes are listed with detailed explanations in [upgrading Gradle X](userguide/upgrading_version_(X-1).html).

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

### Setters for `classes` and `classpath` on `ValidateTaskProperties`

There should not be setters for lazy properties like `ConfigurableFileCollection`s.
Use `setFrom` instead.

    validateTaskProperties.getClasses().setFrom(fileCollection)
    validateTaskProperties.getClasspath().setFrom(fileCollection)
